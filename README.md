# Linux Electron Shortcuts

Small compilation of .desktop files for applications that I use so I don't have to look it up every time I need it


## Instructions

chmod these file so they are owned by root and copy them to:

```
/usr/share/applications
```

or (probably don't cmod them?) copy them to:

```
~/.local/share/applications
```
